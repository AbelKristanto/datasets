Hi there! We're so glad you found me here. We've worked hard to organize an dataset in one platform, so please feel free to look around and learn more about this. The available datasets obtained by open source are as follows:
1. [Banks](https://github.com/AbelKristanto/datasets/blob/main/banks/bank.csv)
2. [SMS Spam](https://github.com/AbelKristanto/datasets/blob/main/spamSMS/SMSSpamCollection.csv)
